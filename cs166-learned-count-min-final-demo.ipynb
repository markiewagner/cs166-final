    "It’s easy to walk away from this paper and think: “Huh, ML can replace anything.” But think more critically about the fundamental ideas that the authors introduced. While ML is ubiquitous throughout their work, two tangible takeaways are:\n",
    "Use data probability distributions to optimize data structures\n",
    "Use recursive models & auxiliary structures to optimize data structures\n",
    "Let’s explore these ideas a bit further. The original paper focuses mainly on indexing structures, like B-Trees, Hash Maps, and Bloom Filters. Since we plan to investigate the effects of probability distributions on these structures, let’s take a deep-dive into a probabilistic structure instead — the Count-Min Sketch."

    "The plots below shows a scatterplot of errors with data points (left), the distribution of data (center), and the distribution of errors (right). Again, we can see that the Count-Min Sketch gives us decent estimates; none of the errors exceed the threshold, which is excellent! But interestingly, by converting to a normal distribution, our average error almost halved, from 20.154 to 11.4482, and our max error shot up by 12."

You know 2020 data is likely to be close to that of 2019 (barring a pandemic, among other things :/), so you treat the most frequent queries from 2019 as heavy hitters. Instead of learning what the heavy-hitters are, we use a rules-based approach.\n",

    "How do we simulate this concept without using ML? Fundamentally, any rules-based approach for determining will give a yes/no answer to whether a given element is a heavy hitter. To emulate this, we can construct a set of data points that will be heavy hitters based on “rules.” Our “rule” is: if the element is within the top p proportion of counts in the data set, it’s a heavy hitter. We can thus iterate through our data set, add all heavy-hitters to a set, and then feed that set into our Sketch constructor. Now, instead of inferring whether an element is a heavy hitter, we can simply check its presence within our set."
